# Fast Logger

> Capture your logs

## What's this for?

The idea is, that you capture some logs XYZ and then
send them to this endpoint "POST <host:port>/log". 

On that endpoint any file can be uploaded and is saved.

## Is this save?

Probably not :). It's not considered save to allow uploading
files to any old folder.
